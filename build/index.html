support or not. But the experience is not the same everywhere: state-level political and policy decisions make life particularly difficult for low-income individuals and families in some states and work to ameliorate the worst impacts of poverty in others. Likewise, there is significant variability in housing prices and overall cost of living across state lines. The end result is that families and individuals of comparable means face very different challenges, under different conditions, from state to state.</p><p class="upper__text">The upshot of all of this is that, should the opportunity present itself, low-income citizens who are seeking better opportunities can make an informed decision on moving to a state where wages, prices, and policies make it easier to get by and, potentially, to get out of poverty.</p><p class="upper__text">In order to determine which states make life on a limited income the least difficult, RewardExpert analyzed data sets including a total of 22 key indicators in seven categories. These data include measures of 1) income and cost of living, 2) SNAP benefits and other federal and state assistance programs, 3) Insurance and medicaid eligibility, 4) State income taxes and Earned Income Tax Credits, 5) Unemployment and minimum wages, 6) Housing/rent prices, and 7) Debt collection and family leave laws.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--notes section--short"><h2 class="section__title">A Note on Method</h2><div class="notes"><div class="notes-item"><p class="notes-text">The way in which state income taxes are structured can vary dramatically from one state to the next. In some states, there is no income tax, in others, income is taxed equally regardless of amount, and in the rest, there exists a wide range in the number of tax brackets, as well as the rates corresponding to each one. In a nutshell, the lower the top tax bracket is set, the less favorable it is to low-income individuals and families.</p></div><div class="notes-item"><p class="notes-text notes-text--second">In order to put a number on how progressive or regressive a state’s income tax is, we have calculated an index based on the difference between the highest and lowest tax rates and brackets, measured by the percentage increase in the tax rate for every thousand dollars in income. For instance, in Alabama, the state with the most regressive income tax, the top tax bracket is set at $3,000 per year for individuals, and $6,000 for married couples, with a corresponding rate of 5 percent. This represents an increase of 0.43 percent for every thousand dollars of income before the highest tax rate applies, after the standard deduction and personal exemption amounts have been factored in.</p></div></div></section><section class="section section--wide section--top"><div class="section__upper"><div class="section__upper-text"><h2 class="section__title section__title--white section__title--close section__title--padding">The Top Ten States for Low-Income Individuals &amp; Families</h2></div></div><div class="rankings__wrapper rankings__wrapper--green"><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Vermont</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">1</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">First on our list of the best states for low-income families and individuals is Vermont, which like many states in our top ten has a strong Fair Debt Collection Practices Act that applies not only to collection agencies, but also to original creditors. It also has state laws that protect employees who must care for a sick family member or need to leave work to attend any manner of school related activities or attend to emergencies involving a dependent child. The state minimum wage of $10.50 is well above the federal minimum and is indexed to inflation. While median monthly rents in Vermont are slightly above the national average, at $966 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,260 for a two-bedroom, this amounts to approximately one-third of the statewide median income for those who rent, making housing relatively affordable.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Rhode Island</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">2</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">Second-place Rhode Island comes in slightly behind Vermont, largely on account of its slightly lower minimum wage of $10.10 and its lack of a strong state Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. On the other hand, the overall cost of living index is lower in Rhode Island than in Vermont, and its income tax is somewhat more progressive, offering a larger standard deduction of $8,300 for individuals and $16,600 for married couples. Additionally, while rents are comparable to the national average, a whopping 96.6 percent of landlords accept cash rent. Otherwise, Rhode Island and Vermont are broadly comparable, both offering an Earned Income Tax Credit that boosts low-income taxpayers’ incomes, and setting their Medicaid eligibility income level at 138 percent of the federal poverty line for both individuals and families.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">New York</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">3</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">With its high cost of living, and especially its high housing prices, it might surprise some that New York comes in as the third most hospitable state for low-income residents. There are several good reasons why this is the case. In the first place, New York has a very progressive tax code, with a top tax rate that applies only to literal millionaires, a low four percent state income tax that applies to low-income residents, plus an Earned Income credit in the amount of 30 percent of the Federal EITC. The state minimum wage of $10.40 per hour is well above the national average, which makes it easier to afford rents that are also above the national average (but which are presumably lower than the statewide median outside of the New York City metropolitan area). In addition, an above average 96.4 percent of apartment rents can be paid using cash. Family medical leave is legally mandated, and the state’s Fair Debt Collection Practices Act not only applies to original creditors, but shields all but 90 percent of a debtor’s wages from creditors.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Michigan</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">4</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">Michigan takes fourth place on our list by virtue of its relatively low cost of living, coupled with an above average minimum wage of $9.25 per hour that will become indexed to inflation as of 2019. At minimum wage, it takes 17.99 hours per week to cover the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment, or 23.01 hours per week for a two-bedroom.

Although the minimum wage in Illinois of $8.25 per hour is only $1.00 higher than the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour, this goes further here than in states with higher median monthly rents. Even the statewide average for Illinois, which includes Chicago and its affluent suburbs is below the national average ($904 per month for one-bedroom apartments, versus $940, and $1,084 per month, versus $1,166). The situation of low-income Illinoisans is made more secure than in other states by a relatively strong Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which, though it doesn’t apply to original creditors, does shield 85 percent of wages and up to $2,000 of one’s bank account.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Massachusetts</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">6</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">Massachusetts takes its place at number six on the strength of its extensive and generous social programs and unemployment insurance.

Despite being a Medicaid expansion state, it appears that even employers that pay comparably low wages, or have a large part-time workforce offer health benefits at a higher rate than elsewhere, with 55 percent of state residents obtaining insurance through their employers, versus 14 percent with Medicaid and 15 percent with Medicare.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Nevada</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">8</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">Nevada comes in at eighth place due to a combination of several factors. In the first place, Nevada has a cost of living index value that falls in the bottom quintile across the country (18.75th percentile).

Additionally, Nevada’s Low-Income Housing Trust Fund provides rental assistance for residents making less than 60 percent of the area median income, and this assistance is available for up to four years per household.

Median monthly rental prices are well below average, with median rent for a one-bedroom apartment only $604 per month, lower than all but five other states.

The income cutoff for Medicaid in Georgia is even lower than in Virginia, with families qualifying for Medicaid only below 36 percent of the federal poverty line and non-disabled individuals without children not qualifying at all with any amount of income. While Georgians’ average SNAP benefit is above the national average, at $257.46 per month, the number of qualifying households and the total amount of benefits paid are falling precipitously. The minimum wage in Georgia is no higher than the federal minimum of $7.25, and the state income tax code is more regressive than anywhere but Alabama: while the lowest tax rate is only 1 percent, the top tax rate of 6 percent kicks in well below the poverty line, at $7,000 annual income for individuals and $10,000 for married couples.</p></div></div></div><div class="rankings__item"><div class="rankings__item-header"><h3 class="rankings__item-title"><span class="semibold">Virginia</span></h3></div><div class="rankings__item-content"><div class="rankings__item-num-block"><p class="rankings__item-num">2</p></div><div class="rankings__item-text-wrapper"><p class="rankings__item-text">Low income families and individuals in Virginia struggle with a relatively high cost of living, especially when it comes to monthly housing costs, and get little in the way of assistance.

Debt</h2><div class="tips__upper-text"><div class="tips__icon"><img src="images/svg/icon_cards.svg"></div><p class="main-text">If you need a little help paying off outstanding debt or making a big purchase, there’s good news. There are a number of <a href="https://www.rewardexpert.com/credit-cards/categories/best-0-interest-credit-cards">credit cards that offer interest-free financing</a> for purchases and balance transfers. With these cards, new members get an introductory period of up 21 months of 0% APR, giving you an opportunity to pay down some debt without incurring any additional interest charges.</p></div><div class="tips__items"><div class="tips__item"><div class="tips__item-title tips__item-title--dining">Transfer Your High-Interest Debt</div><div class="tips__item-text">If you have an outstanding balance on a high-interest credit card, you could save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by getting a new <a href="https://www.rewardexpert.com/credit-cards/categories/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards" class="tips__item-text-link">card that offers a 0% intro APR period for balance transfers</a>. These cards will give you a little breathing room to pay off some or all of that debt without additional interest charges.</div><div class="tips__item-text"><a href="https://www.rewardexpert.com/credit-cards/cards/citi-diamond-preferred-card" class="tips__item-text-link">The Citi Diamond Preferred</a> is one of the best cards available for balance transfers because it offers 0% APR for 21 months. That’s the longest introductory interest-free period you’re going to find. You’ll have nearly two years with no interest.</div><div class="tips__item-text">While you will have to pay a transfer fee of $5 or 5 percent, whichever is greater, that’s typical for these types of cards. Not only that, but that fee is a drop in the bucket compared to how much you can save in interest over 21 months.</div></div><div class="tips__item"><div class="tips__item-title tips__item-title--entertainment">Finance a Big Purchase</div><div class="tips__item-text">Have you been putting off the purchase of a big ticket item because you don’t have enough cash?

Not only will you get 14 months of interest-free financing for both purchases and balance transfers, but you’ll earn up to 5 percent cash back at the same time.</div><div class="tips__item-text">This card offers 5 percent back in <a href="https://www.rewardexpert.com/blog/discovers-5-cashback-calendar/" class="tips__item-text-link">bonus categories</a> that rotate every quarter. They typically include popular retailers and categories, such as wholesale clubs, gas stations, restaurants, grocery stores and Amazon. You’ll get 1 percent back for all other purchases.</div><div class="tips__item-text">More than that, Discover will match every penny you earn in cash back during your first year as a cardholder. That means you’ll get a phenomenal 10 percent for bonus purchases and 2 percent for everything else.</div></div><div class="tips__item"><div class="tips__item-title tips__item-title--supermarkets">Get the Right Card</div><div class="tips__item-text">There are so many credit cards that offer a promotional 0% APR period that there’s sure to be one to fit your needs.

Where cost of living index values were available for multiple cities within one state, we calculated a statewide average.</p><p class="methodology__text-item">We then calculated additional figures from these data sets, such as the number of hours required to earn the equivalent of one month’s rent at minimum wage, monthly per-household SNAP benefit amounts, and so forth. In the case of state income taxes, we calculated an “income tax regressivity index,” which measures how fairly lower-income taxpayers are treated under each state’s income tax code.</p><p class="methodology__text-item">Finally, we calculated percentile rankings for each indicator and calculated a final ranking as the average of these values.</p></div></div><a href="" class="methodology__sources-link"></a><div class="methodology__sources methodology__sources--indicators"><h3 class="methodology__sources-title">Sources & Indicators:</h3><ul class="methodology__sources-list"><li class="methodology__sources-list-item"><h4 class="methodology__sources-list-title">SNAP</h4><ul class="methodology__sources-sublist"><li class="methodology__sources-sublist-item">1. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" class="methodology__sources-link">SNAP Benefits</a></li><li class="methodology__sources-sublist-item">2. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" class="methodology__sources-link">SNAP Households</a></li><li class="methodology__sources-sublist-item">3. <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" class="methodology__sources-link">Year-over-year change</a> (per household benefits and number of households) (USDA)</li></ul></li><li class="methodology__sources-list-item"><h4 class="methodology__sources-list-title">Insurance & Medicaid</h4><ul class="methodology__sources-sublist"><li class="methodology__sources-sublist-item">4. <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/" class="methodology__sources-link">Medicaid Expansion</a> (H.
